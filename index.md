## Welcome to the first day of the rest of your life

Hi everybody, this is my portfolio as you can read in the title and in the subtitle. My name is Pol, as you can also read in the title and in the subtitle. Maybe you are asking yourself why i'm writing, don't look to me for answers, i don't know.

And look forward to my growing old, to grow is to change, to change is to be new,
to be new is to be young again, I barely remember when.

My memories are stolen by the morning, blotted out by the suns hypnotic eye.

### School

Nowadays I'm coursing my Bachellor degree at Virolai School.


### Big data

This pages was made during Big Data optative, with José Luís Tourón's help. It uses some layouts and styles from the Jekyll theme.
